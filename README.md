# Welcome to code-link
`code-link` is a react x electron code editor.

## Get started
`code-link` is an electron app. Visit the [electron docs](https://electronjs.org/docs) to get started in your machine.
Written in Typescript, because it's so much better.

Simple steps to boot it up:
- Download [current Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)
- Clone this project into a directory
- Install dependencies with `npm install`
- Create a `.env` file in the root dir. See [dotenv package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/dotenv)
- (Optional) Install React Developer Tools in Chrome and populate the `.env` file local path name.
- Run `npm start`

## Motivation
Mostly to learn electron and react. But also to develop language-pluggable syntax highlighting and lexical analysis libraries, experiment with code-editing functionalities and visuals and build a browser compat editor with performant syntax highlighting.

## Documentation
Check the [wiki](https://github.com/Pfuster12/code-link/wiki) for documented electron issues affecting the app and workarounds if necessary.
